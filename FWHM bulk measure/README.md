#FWHM measure methods

A bulk FWHM measuring algorithm was designed and written using ImageJ macro language. Using the ImageJ interface the user defines a line using the Segmented line tool which follows the contour of the GUV to be measured. The algorithm is then run and will interpolate along the user-defined line and calculates points at regular intervals (3 pixel gap). At each interpolated point on the line a perpendicular lines is drawn 40 pixels in length and centred on the interpolated line. Along each of these perpendicular lines the intensity values are sampled and a Gaussian curve is fit using the ImageJ curve fitting plugin. The parameters of each curve are then output and the FWHM calculated for each curve (2\*sqrt(2\*log(2)\*sigma), where sigma of Gaussian fit).
